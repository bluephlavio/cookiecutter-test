This is a project template that I use for high school physics tests.

## Dependencies

You need these python packages installed in your machine:

* [latest](https://github.com/bluephlavio/latest)
* cookiecutter

## How to generate a project

Run

```bash
$ cookicutter https://github.com/bluephlavio/cookiecutter-test
```

and answer the questions. The project will be generated based on your entries!
Finally, from inside your project directory, run

```bash
$ make <target>
```

to build the targets.
